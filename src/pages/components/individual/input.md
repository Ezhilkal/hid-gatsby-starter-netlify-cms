## **G﻿uidelines**

* Where possible, add programmatic assistance. Detect and pre-fill inputs to reduce errors and save time. For example Placeholder text provides hints or examples of what to enter.
* When the software can’t determine the value that belongs in an input, use type-ahead to make suggestions.
* Use sentence-case for default values, detected values, and auto-completion text.

The text area and text input components have different use cases. Consider the length and type of content when choosing between them.

**W﻿hen to use**

**Text input** - For single-line, short entries, use the text input component. It’s commonly used for name, phone number, or email entries in forms. 

**Text area** -If text exceeds more than one line, use the text area component. The larger field size encourages longer responses. It’s typically used for comments or questions in forms.
