  Modals are effective in breaking user flow by design. They are most effective
  when a task must be completed before a user can continue. When used correctly,
  modals should be used sparingly to limit disruption to a user experience. They
  might be a blessing of additional screen real estate, providing a way to
  deliver contextual information, notifications and other actions relevant to
  the current screen. On the other hand, modals might feel like a hack that
  you’ve been forced to commit in order to cram extra content on the screen.


  Don’t surprise users by popping up a modal. Let a user’s action, such as a button click, following a link or selecting an option, trigger the modal. Uninvited modals may surprise the user and result in a quick dismissal of the window.


  When modal is open, use a lightbox effect (darken the background). This draws attention to the modal and indicates that the user cannot interact with the parent page.

## General Guidance

**You may consider using a modal window when you need to:**

* **Grab the user’s attention** - Use when you want to interrupt a user’s current task to catch the user’s full attention to something more important.
* **Need user input** - Use when you want to get information from the user. Ex. sign up or login form.
* **Show additional information in context** - Use when you want to show additional information without losing the context of the parent page. Ex. showing larger images or videos.
* **Show additional information (not in context)** - Use when you want to show information that is not directly related to the parent page or other options that are “independent” from other pages. Ex. notifications.
