## The Building Blocks

Components are the key building blocks of any design system. Each component has been designed and coded to solve a specific UI problem for our users. These problems include presenting a list of options to select, enabling the submission of a form, providing feedback, and so on. All of the components in HID Galaxy System have been designed to work together, as parts of a greater whole.
