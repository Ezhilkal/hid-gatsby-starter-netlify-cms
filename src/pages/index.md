    - title: "Design System: For Designers"
      text: When a Product Designer (UX and UI Design) they now have a substantial and
        ever-growing library of things like buttons, input fields, tables,
        typefaces, and colors to utilize when creating hi-fidelity mockups. The
        list and basic snapshots of those design elements are represented on
        this site, but they use our Figma files to utilize the actual
        components. Specifics on this can be found on the "Getting Started" page
        of this website.
    - title: "Design System and Pattern Library: For Developers/Engineers"
      text: >
        Most scrum teams across HID and the various BAs (Business Areas) work
        hand in hand with a Product Designer, but that's not always the case.
        Anyone building applications, with or without the benefit of a designer,
        can use this site to review and understand our company's UI styles.
        There are currently two methods for them to actually enable our styles
        in their code (more detail on the Getting Started page of this site).
        For teams using React, we have partnered with our talented colleagues in
        Chennai, India to build the RPL (React Pattern Library). Our goal is to
        provide the building blocks for developers to build applications without
        "reinventing the wheel" every time. For teams that don't use React, we
        also offer a CSS library that will at least enable them to style their
        UI with the same intuitive and clean manner as other HID software.
        Again, refer to the Getting Started page for details.

Tï»¿hink of our Design System as visual language through which cross-functional teams across HID Global can empower our users with clear and consistent User Interface and Patterns. All of the UI components, widgets and our responsive grid system not only provide users with intuitive and consistent interactions across BAs, products, and user roles--this system provides Engineers/Developers and Scrum Teams an efficient way to build software with less churn (back and forth with designers and other teams).
