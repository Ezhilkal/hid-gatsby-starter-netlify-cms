## General Guidance

**Buttons** express actions that occur when the user clicks or touches it. Buttons are used to initialize an action, either in the background or foreground of an experience.

Buttons are **used primarily** on action items. Some examples include **Add**, **Save**, **Delete**, and **Login**. Each page can have one (1) or two (2) primary buttons. Any remaining calls-to-action must be represented as secondary buttons.

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page. Use this pattern sparingly.
