description: "A link is generally a word or short phrase used as navigational
    elemenets between pages or reference data. In some cases links can be

## General Guidance

Links are used primarily as a navigational element. Links may also change what or how data is displayed (i.e., view more, show all). If the action taken by the user will change or manipulate data, use aÂ [button](http://galaxy-ui-design-system.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/galaxy-design/button-overview).
