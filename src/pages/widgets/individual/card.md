Galaxy ships a basic card structure that responds to the grid. Cards have no pre-set styles for the content within them. This allows designer and developers to customize cards as it fits into the specific use case.

When using a call-to-action (CTA) within a tile, use a secondary button.Â *Primary buttons are reserved for the most important action a user can take on the page.*
