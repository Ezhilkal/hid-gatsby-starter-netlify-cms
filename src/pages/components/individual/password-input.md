title: Password Input
description: The visual style of password inputs is identical to other text
  inputs except that the user’s input is displayed as dots for privacy reasons.
  Optionally an “eye” icon can be displayed to the right of the content,
  allowing the user to toggle between “show” or “hide” mode. This is considered
  best practice because the user can verify what they enter. The eyeball icon
  should appear open when the actual field input is legible, and should appear
  closed (sometimes denoted by a slash mark through the eye) to denote that the
  field input is displayed as dots (private mode).
