# **G﻿uidelines**

* Badge is used in order to just attract the users attention to the specific control and encourage them to explore what is inside.
* Other uses may include communicating status and other types of non-critical notifications in an interface.
* They are contextual. They are associated with a UI element or with a piece of content, and should be shown in close proximity to that element.
* The Badge should slightly overlap the parent icon and should be positioned towards the top and to the right.

**W﻿hen to use**

**Badge with number** - use this for counts of important information, close to the relevant item.\
**Dot only badge with Icons** - use this to gain users attention to the specific control and to encourage them to explore what is inside, without showing any count.

**D﻿o not use**

Badge is only used to provide advisory information to the user, do not use it for communicating high priority information, instead use notification.\
Do not add multiple badges to a single icon. This makes it complicated for the user to recognise it’s intended meaning.
