title: Header
description: >-
  The global header is the anchor of any HID service, or platform, and spans all
  other parts of the UI.


  The functionality in the header is applicable across all contexts in the HID ecosystem and consists mainly of a logo element, title of the service (which acts as a wayfaring cures for platforms with multiple services) and action bar (icons) which groups platform wide tasks that need to persist throughout the experience (i.e - account, app launcher and platform settings)

## General Guidance

This header is part of the HID UI shell. A shell is a collection of components shared by all products within a platform. It provides a common set of interaction patterns that persist between and across products.

The UI shell is made up of four components/widgets: The header, the left panel (optional), the right panel (optional) and footer. All four can be used independently, but they are designed to work together, if required.
