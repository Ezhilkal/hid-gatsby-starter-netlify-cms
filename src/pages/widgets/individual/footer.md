  A footer serves site visitors who arrive at the bottom of a page without
  finding what they want.

  Sometimes used for additional navigation items which are significantly less important global items but yet need to be there (i.e. terms of service or privacy policies).

## **General Guidance**

Footer guidance will change dependant on the product being developed For example a external website user will have different needs from a footer than an internal web application. Generally, the footer is NOT a catch all for anything you do not know where else to put. Since users rarely make it to the end of pages, it should be minimised to only the things users expect to find as in the items below.

* Link to Privacy Policy
* Software version

Less frequently used because it depends on platform and audience

Use tab focus. Code the navigation so that pressing the tab key moves focus from link to link in the navigation.
