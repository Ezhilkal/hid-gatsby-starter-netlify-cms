## **Guidelines**

Cards are a highly flexible component for displaying a wide variety of content, including informational, getting started, how-to, next steps, and more.

When using a call-to-action (CTA) within a tile, use a secondary button. Primary buttons are reserved for the most important action a user can take on the page.

**Read-only**\
Read-only tiles are used to display information to the user, such as features or services offered. Read-only tiles are often seen on marketing pages to promote content. These tiles can have internal calls-to-action (CTAs), such as a button or a link.

**Clickable**\
Clickable tiles can be used as navigational items, where the entire tile is a clickable state, which redirects the user to a new page. Clickable tiles cannot contain separate internal CTAs.

**Selectable**\
Selectable tiles work like a radio button, where the entire tile is a click target. Selectable tiles may contain internal CTAs (like links to docs) if the internal CTA is given its own click target. Selectable tiles work well for presenting options to a user in a structured manner, such as a set of pricing plans.

**Expandable**\
Expandable tiles are helpful for hiding/showing larger amounts of content to a user. They can only be stacked in a single column, and cannot live in a row or horizontal grid. When expanded, tiles push content down the page. Expandable tiles may contain internal CTAs (like links to docs) if the internal CTA is given its own click target.
