# **G﻿uidelines**

Content switchers are frequently used to let users switch between a content group. They are used to narrow content groups, for example, switching between a day, week or month view in a calendar UI.\
\
A Content Switcher should only be used for up to 5 options. It is ideal when there are 2 or 3 because they visually expose the options available to a user.\
\
Only one content tab can be selected at a time and the first content tab in the switcher should be determined based on usage and should always be the default selection.\
\
Text labels should be clear and concise and avoid the usage of mixing text and images in a single content tab to avoid confusing the users. This is particularly helpful for users of assistive technologies so they have the necessary information to efficiently navigate the content.\
\
Try to keep segment content size consistent.

**W﻿hen to use**

Use Content switcher to toggle between or Narrow down a content group. For example, switching between dark or Light Theme in a Page.\
\
**D﻿o not use**

Do not use Content switcher to navigate between related sections of content, use Tabs instead. Tabs divide and categorise large amounts of content on a page, displaying one section at a time.
