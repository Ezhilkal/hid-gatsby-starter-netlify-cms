## General Guidance

Select is a type of input that is used in forms, in cases where a user has to choose an option from a list of options

### A Select is not a [Dropdown](http://galaxy-ui-design-system.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/galaxy-design/dropdown-overview)

The select and dropdown components may behave similarly but in fact, they have different functions.

The select component is typically used inside a form where users are selecting from a list of options and submitting data whereas the dropdown component is used to filter or sort content on a page.

The select component’s appearance is decided by the browser that is being used while the dropdown component can be styled as needed.
