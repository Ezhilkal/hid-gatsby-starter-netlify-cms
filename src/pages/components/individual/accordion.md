title: Accordion
description: The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a
  small space through progressive disclosure. That is, the user gets key details
  about the underlying content and can choose to expand that content within the
  constraints of the accordion. Accordions work especially well on mobile
  interfaces or whenever vertical space is at a premium.
