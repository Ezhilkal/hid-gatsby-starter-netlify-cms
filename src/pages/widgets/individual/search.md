description: Search is one of the most important features in many UIs. Users
  expect it to be fast, intelligent, and simple. With global search, users can
  get right to records and apps by entering simple keywords or using powerful
  advanced search features. In-context search is where users can refine content
  on a page to find the correct information without having to context-shift or
  navigate away as with global search.
