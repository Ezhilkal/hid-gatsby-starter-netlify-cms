title: Radio Button
description: Radio buttons are shown in a group of two or more. The user can
    only select one radio button at a time. You should use the same nameattribute
    on all radio buttons in the group. This ensures that if there is more than one
    group in the form, each one stays associated with its own group.

## General Guidance

Radio buttons are used when a list of two or more options are mutually exclusive, meaning the user must select only one option.
