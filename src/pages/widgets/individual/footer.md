description: Sometimes used for additional navigation items which are
  significatnly less important global items but yet need to be there (i.e. terms
  of service or privacy policies), the current footer is used more for identity

## General Guidance

Footer guidance will change dependant on the product being developer. For example a external website user will have different needs from a footer than an internal web application. Generally, the footer is NOT a catch all for anything you do not know where else to put. Since users rarely make it to the end of pages, it should be minimzed to only the things users expect to find as in the items below.
