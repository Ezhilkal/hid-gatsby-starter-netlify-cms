**Guidance and Usage**\
The breadcrumb component is a well-known secondary navigation pattern that shows hierarchy among content or traces a user’s path. Breadcrumbs are space efficient and high utility design that enable users to move quickly up to a parent level or previous step.\
\
**When to use**\
Breadcrumbs are very effective in products and experiences that have a large amount of content organized in a heirarchy of more than two levels. They are also highly effective in flows that contain multiple steps.\
\
**Do not use**\
Breadcrumbs are always treated as secondary and should never entirely replace the primary navigation.
