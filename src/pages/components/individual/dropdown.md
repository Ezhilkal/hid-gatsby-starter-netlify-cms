## General Guidance

A dropdown provides a user with an input field that is either an autocomplete or readonly, accompanied by a listbox of options.

### A dropdown is not a [Select](http://galaxy-ui-design-system.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/galaxy-design/select-overview)

The dropdown and select components may seem to behave similarly. They, in fact, have vastly different functions.

The dropdown component is used to filter or sort content on a page whereas the select component is typically used inside a form where users are selecting from a list of options and submitting data.

The dropdown component can be styled as needed while the select component’s appearance is decided by the browser that is being used.

Dropdowns can also be used as menus. Their use as menus can be seen in [tabs](http://galaxy-ui-design-system.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/galaxy-design/tab-overview). At a smaller screen size, the tabs collapse into a dropdown.
