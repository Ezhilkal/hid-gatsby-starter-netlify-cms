## About Avatars

An avatar can be circular or a rounded rectangle, depending on usage. The default is a rounded rectangle and requiresÂ `.hid-avatar`as the base class.

## Accessibility

> ### Accessibility Best Practice
>
> -   If you need to define a size different from the predefined one, make sure that the font size is consistent with the size of the control itself.
> -   If you use initials or icons and want to display a custom size for the avatar that is between two predefined sizes, use the predefined font size for the smaller one. For example, if your avatar is 5.5 rem, between sizes L and XL, then you should use the font size for size L: 2 rem.
> -   For accessibility reasons, provide each image in the avatar with an alternative text in case the image is not available or cannot be displayed.
