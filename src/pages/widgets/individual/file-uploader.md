title: File Uploader
description: >
  File uploaders allow users to upload content of their own. A file uploader is
  commonly found in forms, but can also live as a standalone element. We have 3
  variants of file uploader buttons. A basic button, a button with text and an
  icon, and a button that is icon only.
